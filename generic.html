								<h2>In one word</h2>
								<p>Human</p>
								<h2>In ten seconds</h2>
								<p> Expected to be a Master`s degree student in the Brain and Cognitive Science Department at the <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/"> Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) </a>in the Republic of Korea. Received a Master's degree in Molecular Medicine at the <a href=http://imit-jnu.or.kr> Institute for Molecular Imaging and Theranostics (iMIT) </a> of Chonnam National University. Two years of working experience as a research coordinator at the Center for Contemplative Science at KAIST.</p>
								<h2>In ninety seconds</h2>
								<h3>Bachelor’s Degree</h3>
								<p>I have earned my bachelor's degree in biology from Abant Izzet Basyal University in Türkiye. During my bachelor's degree, I worked as an RA where I conducted experiments on medicinal plants to evaluate their antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant efficacy under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Arzu Uçar Türker. My main project was about assessing the in vitro antiproliferative, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of different extracts of aerial parts of Inula Viscosa and their phenolic constituents.</p>
								<h3>Master’s Degree</h3>
								<p>I was a master's student at the iMIT under the guidance of Professor Jung-Joon Min, a renowned expert in Molecular Imaging and Theranostics in Korea. My Master's project is shaped around tumor-targeted engineered bacteria for cancer therapy.</p> 
								<p>I specifically worked with the constructed avirulent strain of Salmonella Typhimurium which expresses the cytolysin A (ClyA) which is a pore-forming protein, and Rluc8 which is a Doxycycline inducible reporter protein. We aimed to analyze the interaction of cancer cells and ΔppGpp S. Typhimurium expressing ClyA, focusing on bacterial distribution and therapeutic efficacy depending on tumor multiplicity.</p>
								<h3>Working Experience</h3>
								<p>I worked as a research coordinator in the Center for Contemplative Science at KAIST for two years. As a research coordinator, I took roles in both research and education units. The research unit included self-report studies and clinical trials. I contributed to qualitative data analysis, writing and editing research papers, and I collaborated for the IRB preparation for the Development and Neurophysiological Studies of Compassion-Based Intervention (Heart-Smile Training Intensive Introduction Program) joint project with the colleagues in Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) Center for Mindfulness & Compassion. In the education unit, I  coordinated mindfulness and compassion English programs and moderated and facilitated online live sessions.</p>
								<p>With time, I became increasingly interested in understanding the complicacy of the brain and mind and its impacts. I plan to start all over with a Master’s degree to gain fundamental knowledge in the brain and cognitive science field while developing technical skills to be able to perform in this field and detail my working areas, especially in the emotion, memory, and attention network system by integrating contemplative science in the future.
								</p>
								<p>Currently, I am expecting to be a Master's student on September 2023.</p>
